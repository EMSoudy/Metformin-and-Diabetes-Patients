# Metformin-and-Diabetes-Patients

Analyzing the effect(s) of Metformin, an oral drug used to treat high blood sugar levels, on patients diagnosed with diabetes type 2 or diabetes mellitus

Included:

- Spreadsheet of all data
- JSON code (Visual Studio Code)
- jQuery code (Linux via ACER)
- CSV output from jQuery code 

Data was provided from randomly sampled patients with diabetes to understand the effects of a single drug, Metformin and their HbA1c

Process:

- Excel file was converted into a JSON file from scratch
- The JSON includes only data relevant to analyzing the effects of Metformin
- A syntax of jQuery was created to turn the JSON into a table in CSV format

Outcome:

- Metformin slightly improved the HbA1c of patients with diabetes; however, more interventions are needed in order to see a substantial improvement of HbA1c

-Metformin alone is not enough to change a patient's diabetes status from diabetic to pre-diabetic or nondiabetic
