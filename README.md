# Metformin-and-Diabetes-Patients

Analyzing the effect(s) of Metformin, an oral drug used to treat high blood sugar levels, on patients diagnosed with diabetes type 2 or diabetes mellitus

Included:

	- Spreadsheet of all data
	- JSON code (Visual Studio Code)
	- jQuery code (Linux via ACER)
	- CSV output from jQuery code 

Data was provided from randomly sampled patients with diabetes to understand the effects of a single drug, Metformin and their HbA1c

Process:

	- Excel file was converted into a JSON code from scratch
	- JSON code only included data relevant to analyzing the effects of Metformin
	- jQuery code was created to turn the JSON code into a CSV table
	- Outcome of jQuery code was a table in  CSV format

Outcome:

- Metformin slightly improved the HbA1c of patients with diabetes; however, more interventions are needed in order to see a substantial improvement of HbA1c
-Metformin alone is not enough to change a patient's diabetes status from diabetic to pre-diabetic or nondiabetic
